## How the MoPub Marketplace Works

The MoPub Marketplace is a real-time exchange which links billions of auctions daily amongst more than 180 real-time bidding platforms. In this session, weâ€™ll discuss how the exchange works, how exchanges maximize developer revenue, and take a look at the technologies which make this scale possible.

You can follow along with the slides as you watch the talk.
