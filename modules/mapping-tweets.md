## Mapping Millions of Tweets

The locations of geotagged tweets over time are a valuable source for understanding patterns of urban activity and mobility. I'll discuss retrieving tweets from the Twitter Streaming API, despeckling, debanding, and de-duplicating the data to reduce distracting artifacts, generating vector map tiles with Tippecanoe, and styling the map with Mapbox Studio, along with some highlights of the resulting map.

You can follow along with the slides as you watch the talk.
