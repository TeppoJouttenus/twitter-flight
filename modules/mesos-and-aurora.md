## Twitter’s Production Scale: Mesos and Aurora Operations

Twitter has used Aurora and Mesos to grow from only tens of nodes to tens of thousands. During the process of scaling up, the configuration, deployment, and operational procedures for this system have evolved and improved significantly. This talk will offer an operations perspective on the management of a Mesos+Aurora cluster, and cover many of the cluster management best practices that have evolved at Twitter from real-world production experience.

You can follow along with the slides as you watch the talk.
