## Of the Order of Billions: Building Observability at Twitter

Every minute Twitter’s Observability stack processes 1.5+ billion metrics in order to provide Visibility into Twitter’s distributed microservices architecture. This talk will focus on some of the challenges associated with building and running this large scale distributed system. We will also focus on lessons learned and how to build services that scale that are applicable for services of any size.

You can follow along with the slides as you watch the talk.
